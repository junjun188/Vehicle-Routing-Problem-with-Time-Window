Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Window(VRPTW) using Discrete Bat Algorithm(DBA)

Bat Algorithm(BA)

Bat algorithm is based on the echolocation behavior of bats. It is a metaheuristic method. All bats use echolocation to sense distance, and they also know the difference between food/prey and background barriers in some magical way. In simulations, we use virtual bats naturally.
 
Discrete Bat Algorithm(DBA)

Bat algorithm applies to the continuous domain. In the following, we extend bat algorithm to the discrete domain where we call this algorithm as discrete bat algorithm.
